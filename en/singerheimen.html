<p>Singerheimen was built in 1921 by the couple William H. Singer Jr. and Anna Brugh Singer. Today, Singerheimen is protected through use and the hosts offer tours, accommodation, quizzes, concerts and pizza service.<br></p>

<h3>History</h3>
<p>
William Singer was born in Pittsburgh in 1868. He inherited a large fortune from the steel company Singer Nimick & Co, but he chose art instead of the business. William married Anna Spencer Brugh in 1895.
The couple first visited Norway in 1903 and Olden in 1913. They enjoyed themselves here, and immediately after the First World War they began plans to make their home in Olden. The studio was built
in 1914 and the rest of the buildings were built in 1921. In the summer of the same year, they moved in. Singer drew much inspiration from the nature in the area for his paintings. <br>
</p>
<h3>Traces on the village</h3>
<p>
Mrs. Singer said that she had wanted to buy the entire valley. They never did this, but they left a deep mark on the poor village. The construction of the buildings provided work for a dozen people, and at most
30 servants worked on the property. The workers often spoke of how caring and warm Anna and William were. In addition to Singerheimen, or Dalheim as it was called at the time, Singer helped with funds
to build the road between Olden and Innvik, Nordfjordeid Hospital, Olden New Church, the village hall and a power plant for the village.
</p>

<h3>Buildings</h3>
<p>
The main house in Singerheimen is a villa of almost 1,000 square meters. In addition to this, there is a barn, a guest house, a woodshed, a servants' quarters, a storehouse and a studio. There is also a mausoleum where both William (died 1943)
and Anna (died 1962) lie embalmed. <br><br>
