<h1>The smallest and coldest beach in Norway</h1>
<p>The beach, which is located in the heart of the village, has a width of 2,5 meters and has a water temperature of between 5 and 8 degrees<br></p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>In 2019, merchant André Opheim hung up a sign informing people that this is the smallest and coldest beach in the country. The melting water straight from the Briksdalsbreen glacier
means that the temperature, even on the hottest summer days, remains in the single digits. What the beach lacks in temperature, it makes up for in luxury. The beach has
fine white shell sand and a view that few can beat.
</p>

<h3>Popularity</h3>
<p>
After the sign went up, the beach has become a popular destination among tourists. Some are brave enough to go for a swim in the cold water. 
<br><br>A couple of years after the opening, André set up a sauna where people can warm up after a cold dip. This has also made the beach a year-round beach, there 
the extra brave can take a dip in winter.
